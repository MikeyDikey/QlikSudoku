        I agree with the author of the Programming assignment. "The assignement can grow almost indefinitely" and I would like to have refactored the code in FileReader to use a utility
        class like BufferReader and also use division and modulus operators in the Solver class to
        make the code shorter and more efficient instead of the many for loops. I
        chose to store the Sudoku in a char matrix (char[][]) as a Sudoku plane basically is a
        matrix. To chose chars and not ints might seems strange but that was how I started when
        reading the files and I kept it that way in the end. All for Sudoku examples can be loaded from the menu. I did not
        implement a picker for a text file from the file system but this can be added on request.\n

        Part 2.
        \n
        I have written an algorithm that solves the Sudoku games. I tried out some variant using for
        and while loops but soon cam to the conclusion that it needed to be solved by recursion. I
        spent quite some time to get the GridView to refresh for every new number that was tried but
        the algorithm so one could see the algorithm in work in the UI but I could only manage to get
        a refresh for the full solution.
